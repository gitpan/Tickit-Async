NAME
    "Tickit::Async" - use "Tickit" with "IO::Async"

SYNOPSIS
     use IO::Async;
     use Tickit::Async;

     my $tickit = Tickit::Async->new;

     # Create some widgets
     # ...

     $tickit->set_root_widget( $rootwidget );

     my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;
     $loop->add( $tickit );

     $tickit->run;

DESCRIPTION
    This class allows a Tickit user interface to run alongside other
    IO::Async-driven code, using "IO::Async" as a source of IO events.

    As a shortcut convenience, if the "run" method is invoked and the object
    is not yet a member of an IO::Async::Loop, then a new one will be
    constructed and the "Tickit::Async" object added to it. This will allow
    a "Tickit::Async" object to be used without being aware it is not a
    simple "Tickit" object.
